## Simple TODO project

This is a test project while developing android applications.

It is a simple application that saves TODO items.

Currently the application supports 3 functions.

 **1) Adding a new item : Add a new item on the text input and click the add button on the main application screen.<br>**
 
 **2) Editing an existing item : Click on an existing item, edit it and save it<br>**
 
 **3) Remove an existing item : Long Click on an existing item and it will remove the item<br>**

##Extra extensions
**a) The application also persists the items to **sqllite database** and restores them on startup<br>**
**b) I have used a custom adapter for displaying data on the listView.<br>**
**c) The Item data model now also supports a due date for the task.<br>**
**d) The due date for the task is shown on the listView using a custom view.<br>**
**e) The due date can be entered using a DatePickerDialog . The edit dialog also has a DatePickerDialog for editing the date.<br>**

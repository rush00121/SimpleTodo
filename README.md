This is a test project while playing how to develop android applications.

It is a simple application that saves TODO items.

Currently the application supports 3 functions.

1) Adding a new TODO item : Add a new TODO item and click the Add button on the main application screen.
2) Editing an existing TODO item : Click on an existing TODO item, edit it and save it
3) Remove an existing TODO item : Long Click on an existing application and it will remove the TODO item

The applicaion also persists the TODO items to file and restores them on startup
